50,"一个机智的编剧，一个会讲故事的导演，一些漂亮的镜头，一群靠谱的演员，干净利落的剪辑！不失为一部成功的商业贺岁片！虽然仍不值得五星，但一开始就一片差评绝对没水军！给五星拉个评论分吧～","A witty writer, a story - telling director, some beautiful scenes, a bunch of actors, a neat editing! It's a successful commercial new year's movie! Although still not worth five, but a start of a bad review is absolutely no navy! Make a comment on the five stars.",0.103504
50,"一部喜剧片，逗大家一笑而已，无关艺术，更无需那么矫情的对待。","A comedy, tease you a smile, not art, no need to treat so hypocritical.",0.154043
50,"上来一看吓了一大跳，这么低的分，几年前的电影现在才看，但是觉得冯小刚情怀是有的，宋丹丹，范伟，举手投足都是戏！","A look startled, so low, the film a few years ago now, but think there is Feng Xiaogang, Song Dandan Wei Fan, feelings, behavior are drama!",0.157236
50,"不为别的，打这么低的分看不下去了。凭什么就这样踩死别人的一部喜剧？太过分了！这是烂片吗？就冲着影院里那么多人看，就冲着这么一些段子我该上7分的。既然你们这么低，偏偏应该顶。比这烂的片都能存个7分8分，舆论导向的坏人们，太坏了！","Not for anything else, so the low score can't be seen. So why do you step on a comedy of others? That's too much！ This is the movie? Just looking at so many people in the cinema, I'm going to get 7 points on some of these. Since you are so low, you should be the top. It can save 7 points and 8 points more than this rotten piece. The bad people who are guided by public opinion are too bad!",0.13598

50,"冯导过了这么多年用商业重新包装了甲方乙方！！！一个烂字了得！","Feng led for so many years to use business to repackage Party B Party B!!! A bad word!",0.137075
50,"冯小刚的电影从没让我失望过，我还是很喜欢冯导的。这个有点像甲方乙方的续集，但是感觉比甲方乙方更好。每一个故事都不仅仅是单纯的故事而已，比如领导不作为就是腐败，比如亿万富翁一起床就是要还贷款等等。以及最后对大自然的道歉。尤其是雅和俗的探讨我也一直很奇怪。艺术到底是大众的还是专家的呢","Feng Xiaogang's movies never let me down. I still like Feng guide. This is a bit like a sequel to Party B, but it feels better than Party B's Party B. Every story is not just a simple story, for example, a leader's inaction is corruption, such as a billionaire who is in bed with a loan and so on. And the last apology for nature. I have been very strange, especially the discussion of elegance and vulgarity. Is art a public or an expert?",0.142267

50,"啊呀特妹的，豆瓣上刚找到私人定制就把我吓一跳~怎么评分这么低？看了老半天评论才找到原因。。。这个电影如果不是冯小刚拍的话，你们是不是就不会平这么低的分了？你们觉得这个片子不是冯氏电影的风格？是什么原因让你们评这么低的分呢?我本来要给个8分的，现在我给个满分你们又能怎样？气死你们","Ah, my sister, I was scared by a personal custom on the bean. How can I score so low? I found the reason for a half day review. If it wasn't for Feng Xiaogang, would you not make such a low score? Do you think the film is not Feng movie style? What is the reason for making such a low score? I would have given 8 points, and now how can I give you a full mark? You mad",0.188349
50,"平衡下，就是甲方乙方2嘛，本来就是几个小品而已，一帮文青何必呢","Under the balance, Party A Party B's 2 is just a few small items. Why is a gang of Wen Qing?",0.148405
50,"打一分的真心过分了，一分是留给富春山居图小时代这种电影的。。。","A divided heart too much, a little time is left to the movie over the map...",0.177511
50,"有的人觉得这是喜剧应该有许多笑料，有的人觉得拍过甲方乙方没必要老调重弹，许多人都用这么专业那么专业去评价这部电影，不求别人赞同我的观点，但是我个人认为这部电影值得一看，这部电影不管是矫揉造作还是什么至少试图表达的意思是许多电影连想都没想到过的。试着想想难道这片子真的这么差吗？","Some people think that it is a comedy should have many jokes, some people think that did not need Party B evaluation of the film sing the same old song, many people are so professional so professional, don't ask others to agree with me, but I personally think that this film is worth watching, this movie is affectation or at least what matter try to express the mean of many movies would never have thought of. Try to think about the film is really so bad?",0.183306
50,"根本就没评的那么差，有笑点有泪点，两个小时无尿点。一个贺岁片，看了笑了就行了将就那么多干啥！","No comment is so bad, there is a smile on the point of tears, two hours of no urine. A new year's film, watching the smile on the line will be so much to do so much!",0.119448
50,"真的不知道大家干嘛都评那么低的分，难道一个导演拍出一些真实的东西，就获得大众如此评价？那你们希望看到的都是些什么东西呢？或许冯导这片子上错了时间，在全民寻求无脑笑一笑的贺岁档，显然不是这么多人买账。","I really do not know why everyone is doing so low points. Is a director taking some real things and getting the public to say so? So what do you want to see? Perhaps Feng guide this film on the wrong time, in the people's search for no brain laugh a smile on the new year's file, obviously not so many people buy accounts.",0.116985
50,"真的很不明白为什么大家都能狠心地打低分，都没看过甲方乙方嘛？这不就是甲方乙方ver2014吗，5星全给甲方乙方。","Really do not understand why everyone can be hard hearted to play low points, did not see Party B Party B? Is this not the Party A Party B's ver2014, 5 stars all to Party A Party B.",0.103345

50,"这是一部电影，也不是电影，是看不过去了的骂街。说好听点叫讽刺，说难听了就是骂街，没脏字而已。通篇就八个字：酒色财气、功名利禄，也懒得编故事了，找一旧瓶，灌上毒药就给你喝。谁当电影看谁SB，谁认真谁SB——谁找麻烦就是说谁呢。特别露骨的黑色幽默，全当借红楼梦一句话：甄士隐去，贾雨村言。","This is a movie, not the movies, is not over the street. My point of satire, said bluntly is not only the dirty street. It is just eight words: don't bother, high official positions and riches story, and find a bottle, filling the poison will give you a drink. Who is a movie watching who SB, who is serious who SB - who is to find trouble is to say who.
