40,"3.5星吧。的确算不得多么好，但确实有一些新意和幽默，而且除了最后那段环保朗诵（当然这也是为了公益，我觉得没什么不好），总体也都看得很舒服。我不知道很多人在期待着什么，对于目前大市场背景下，这片子已经不错了啊","3.5 star. It's not really good, but it does have some novelty and humor. Besides the last environmental recitation (of course, it's also for public good, I don't feel bad about it). Generally, it is also very comfortable. I don't know what a lot of people are looking forward to. It's good for the big market.",0.954411

40,"不知为何这部影片的评价这么低，在电影院感受冯氏的黑色幽默还不错，很接地气，跟甲方乙方换汤不换药。。可能观众的口味上去了~不过我看的还蛮爽的，也不觉得有多烂，王朔是编剧，确实从头到尾的讽刺，只是觉得结尾衔接的不是很好，怎么能很突然地跳跃到环保和道歉的领域，PS:结尾羽泉的歌曲蛮赞的啊~","I do not know why such a low evaluation of the film in the cinema, feeling Feng's black humor is also good, very down to earth, with a superficial reform of Party b.. May the audience up - but I also look pretty cool, don't feel bad, Wang Shuo is a screenwriter, indeed from A to Z irony, just think of the ending of convergence is not very good, how can suddenly jump to the field of environmental protection and an apology, Yu Quan PS: at the end of the song really good ah ~",0.970231

Actually, the film began with Wei Fan's good part. The part of Li Chengru was a bit stiff. The part of Song Dandan was also good. At last, the public welfare micro film seemed a bit out of tune, but it had a very good idea. The whole is still happy. It's better than I thought it was 5.3.",0.948892

40,"就贺岁片需要反映一定社会现状和引人发笑这两点上说，算是一部不错的电影，某些人对它的失望，更多的是因为对冯小刚有过高的期望，以及没有理解贺岁片所应具有的内涵。就像年终总结有喜有思就好，贺岁片能让观众开怀大笑，并且有所反思就好。8分，推荐。","As for the new year's movies, it is a good movie to reflect certain social situations and make people laugh. Some of them are disappointed because of their high expectations for Feng Xiaogang, and no understanding of the connotation of New Year Movies. As the year-end summary of joy and good thinking, new year movies can make the audience laugh, and reflect on the good. 8 points, recommended.",0.958072
40,"年末和家人图个乐子 还是蛮开心的 影院里感觉笑点也很多啊，没有评价那么差啦~还有宋丹丹那一节的结尾我还蛮喜欢的，感觉温情的刚刚好，到那里戛然而止或许也不错~","At the end of the year, I was very happy with my family. I feel very happy in the theater. I feel a lot of laughter in the theater. I didn't feel bad about the evaluation. I also liked the ending of Song Dandan's day. I felt like I was just warming up, and it might be good to stop there.",0.954507

A lot of social phenomena are ironic, and this is the movie. Feng Xiaogang, you didn't let me down! Although the idea is like Party B, there is no surprise in this aspect, but it does not prevent it from being a good movie. We should not just parroting the static under heart again. I watched it on the night of lantern and Valentine's day. It's really nice. It's not as bad as everyone says, at least four stars.",0.958383

The picture is very good, and the performance of the four stars is very good. Ge You's lines are really good. What's not enough is that the plot details are a bit empty, and it's better to design.",0.950087
40,"挺好看的啊，除了最后片尾很多余。虽然片尾挺有意义哒但是电影扯那些文绉绉的就拉长节奏。梁天老了好多真沧桑。宋丹丹数钱那段如果不快进就好了。葛优好厉害，白百合居然有胸真是失敬失敬。","It's pretty good, except that the end of the end is very unnecessary. Although the end is quite significant but at the genteel Da film stretched rhythm. Liang Tian has always been a lot of real vicissitudes. It would be good for Song Dandan to count the money if he didn't hurry in. Ge You good, white lily had the chest is really shijingshijing.",0.952791

I think the good ahead is that you have to like master Wang Shuo, at least the master's text. At the end of the film, I heard someone applauding.

However, some social phenomena are not the film can be changed, people or personal experience is more shocking the driving force. The last piece, the social public welfare of apology is very meaningful, when I also try, see an apology for an apology and an apology for the mountains and rivers.

At the end of this seemingly redundant, but I believe that Feng's good intentions, he used his bet to call for environmental protection office......
