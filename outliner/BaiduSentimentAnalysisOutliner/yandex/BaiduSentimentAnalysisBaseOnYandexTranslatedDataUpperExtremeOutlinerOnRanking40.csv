40,"不知为何这部影片的评价这么低，在电影院感受冯氏的黑色幽默还不错，很接地气，跟甲方乙方换汤不换药。。可能观众的口味上去了~不过我看的还蛮爽的，也不觉得有多烂，王朔是编剧，确实从头到尾的讽刺，只是觉得结尾衔接的不是很好，怎么能很突然地跳跃到环保和道歉的领域，PS:结尾羽泉的歌曲蛮赞的啊~","I don't know why this movie rating is so low, in the cinema feel von's black humor is also good, very ground gas, with Party a party b new name is.. May be the tastes of the audience go up~but I look pretty cool, don't think there is much rotten, Wang Shuo is a writer, and indeed from start to finish the irony, just think of the end of convergence is not good, how can it suddenly jump to the green and apologize to the field, PS:the end of the feather spring song quite like it.~",0.964623

40,"白云苍狗。笑cry~~~ 好吧，说正经的。觉得这片好的提前是你得喜欢王朔大师，至少看过大师的文儿。电影结束的时候，听到有人鼓掌。嗯~除了觉得最后向大自然道歉的桥段有些生硬刻意和突兀之外，其他都挺好的。演员们的浮夸表演绝对是故意的。哈哈~","White clouds Cang Dog. Laugh cry~~~ okay, seriously. But this piece of good advance you gotta like Wang Shuo masters, at least seen the master text-er. The end of the movie when the heard someone clapping. Well~in addition to feel and finally to the nature of the apology plot some blunt deliberate and obtrusive, the other are good. The actors of the grandiose show absolutely intentional. Haha~",0.9792
