50,"我out了吗？我真是俗了吗？怎么这片子会这么低分！？看得出冯导是抱着社会责任感拍的定制！并是对自己的无情批判。与其说是个某个人定制的，还不如说是给这个社会定制的。值得大家去看看，物质和精神、搞笑和煽情的冲击都很激烈。没有让你放声大笑，但是让你思绪良久……","Me out? I'm vulgar? How this film will be so low for!? See Feng guide is to hold the sense of social responsibility shoot! And is on their own ruthless critique. The other is a personal customization, not as it is to this social custom.
