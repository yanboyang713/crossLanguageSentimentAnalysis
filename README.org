** note
+ Baidu sentiment analysis Category Note
 - 2 mean to belong to the positive category, 1 mean to belong to the neutral category, and 0 mean to belong to the Negative category
+ Google sentiment analysis Note
 - The score of a document's sentiment indicates the overall emotion of a document. The magnitude of a document's sentiment indicates how much emotional content is present within the document, and this value is often proportional to the length of the document.
 - A document with a neutral score (around 0.0) may indicate a low-emotion document, or may indicate mixed emotions, with both high positive and negative values which cancel each out. Generally, you can use magnitude values to disambiguate these cases, as truly neutral documents will have a low magnitude value, while mixed documents will have higher magnitude values.
 - “Clearly positive” and “clearly negative” sentiment varies for different use cases and customers. You might find differing results for your specific scenario. We recommend that you define a threshold that works for you, and then adjust the threshold after testing and verifying the results. For example, you may define a threshold of any score over 0.25 as clearly positive, and then modify the score threshold to 0.15 after reviewing your data and results and finding that scores from 0.15-0.25 should be considered positive as well.
